    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last Updated: February 2026</p>

    <p>The <strong>Sleeps To</strong> app was built with a privacy-first mindset. Because we believe your milestones and memories are personal, this app is designed so that your data stays with you.</p>

    <div class="highlight">
        <strong>The Short Version:</strong> We do not collect, store, or sell your personal data. Your countdowns are stored on your devices and synced via your private Apple iCloud account.
    </div>

    <h2>1. Data Storage & Syncing</h2>
    <p>All event data, countdowns, and settings created within <strong>Sleeps To</strong> are stored locally on your device. Syncing between devices (such as your iPhone and Apple Watch) is handled exclusively through <strong>Apple’s iCloud service</strong>.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>We do not have access to your iCloud account.</li>
        <li>We do not host any servers that store your event data.</li>
        <li>Your data is encrypted by Apple during transit and at rest.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Information Collection</h2>
    <p>We do not require you to create an account, and we do not collect any personal identification information (such as your name, email address, or location).</p>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p><strong>Sleeps To</strong> does not use third-party analytics, tracking pixels, or advertising frameworks. We don't track how you use the app.</p>

    <h2>4. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page and reflected in the "Last Updated" date.</p>

    <h2>5. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at: <strong>carbon.docile0a@icloud.com</strong></p>
